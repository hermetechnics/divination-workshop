> A creative workshop where we learn about divination, the various (non-)traditional systems developed around the world, and imagine new methods of divination for the future.

A divination system is, strictly speaking, a very well-designed tool for Making Sense of the World. Practically every human society has developed some sort of tradition, using natural or abstract phenomena to answer questions or make decisions. These traditions were often dismissed as inferior in the scientific consensus of the 20th century. But with the arrival of the Internet and global culture, the world became a complex super-connected network and the analytical ways of Knowing are proving insufficient to make sense of it. Isnâ€™t this hectic and unstable time the right moment to revisit the wisdom of the past?

At [Hermetechnics Inc.](http://hermetechnics.life), we believe that the great questions of our era cannot be answered by a cold, analytical mind alone; we need to rediscover the ancient methods and find new ways to use them in a networked society.  The ubiquity of connectedness and abundance of computational power opens the door to designing new ways of divination - question-answering - which acknowledge the complex, algorithmic and stochastic nature of our problems.
